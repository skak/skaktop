		Fast Confirm is another very lightweight, easy to use and efficient jQuery plugin. 
		It is designed to ask the user for confirmations in an easy and smooth way. 
		You can easily make the bubble appear on top, right, bottom or left side.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, it supports CSS3 to allow modern browser users to have a better experience 
		while keeping HTML as lightweight as possible. This plugin <strong>doesn't use one single image</strong>. 
		The box container is <strong>only made of 2 divs</strong>. 
		I think this is quite self explanatory. But, wait! Old browser users will still have a degraded but nice experience too.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just try to click the button ! <button id="try">Try it!</button>
	</p>
